# NYC COVID-19

## Summary of Notebook
Within our notebooks, our goal was to format the data so that it would be easier to use when we uploaded it into Tableau. Various Functions were created around each individual sheet to be properly formatted as well as be able to add the current day data to Master Sheets, which have been collecting data posted since March 26th, 2020.

## Data
Data has been provided daily by the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene as well as the NYS Department of health. Please with all datasets provided:

## Visualizations
All Visualizations were created in Tableau where an interactive Dashboard was made. Daily updates will be made to the Dashboard as long as data is still being provided. Please see link to Dashboard with analysis performed:
